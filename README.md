                                                           ----------INTRODUCTION----------  
  
A chatbot (also known as a talkbots, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.  
  
Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.  
The term "ChatterBot" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin  in 1994 to describe these conversational programs. Today, most chatbots are either accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, via messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or WeChat, or via individual organizations' apps and websites.  
Chatbots can be classified into usage categories such as conversational commerce (ecommerce via chat), analytics, communication, customer support, design, developer tools, education, entertainment, finance, food, games, health, HR, marketing, news, personal, productivity, shopping, social, sports, travel and utilities.  
Chatbots can be added to a buddy list or provide a single game player with an entity to interact with while awaiting other "live" players. If the bot is sophisticated enough to pass the Turing test, the person may not even know they are interacting with a computer program.  
As consumers continue to move away from traditional forms of communication, chat-based communication methods are expected to rise. Chatbot-based virtual assistants are increasingly used to handle simple tasks, freeing human agents to focus on higher-profile service or sales cases. This leads to cost savings -- employees cost more -- and it also allows companies to provide a level of customer service during hours when live agents aren't available.  
 
 
 
 
                                                         ----------LITERATURE SURVEY----------
                                                         
1.	Endurance: A Companion for Dementia Patients : Many people suffering with dementia retain much of their conversational abilities as their illness progresses. However, the shame and frustration that many dementia sufferers experience often make routine, everyday talks with even close family members challenging. That’s why Russian technology company Endurance developed its companion chat bot. 
Many people with Alzheimer’s disease struggle with short-term memory loss. As such, the chatbot aims to identify deviations in conversational branches that may indicate a problem with immediate recollection – quite an ambitious technical challenge for an NLP-based system. 
 
 In addition, since the chatbot is a cloud- based solution, physicians and family members can review communication logs taken from the bot to identify potential degradation of memory function and communicative obstacles that could signify deterioration of the patient’s condition.Interestingly, the as-yet unnamed conversational agent is currently an open- source project, meaning that anyone can contribute to the development of the bot’s codebase. The project is still in its earlier stages, but has great potential to help scientists, researchers, and care teams better understand how Alzheimer’s disease affects the brain. A Russian version of the bot is already available, and an English version is expected at some point this year. 
 
2.	Casper: Helping Insomniacs Get through the Night: 
 
 If you suffer from insomnia, you’ll know that the feeling of almost suffocating loneliness – the idea that everyone else in the world is resting peacefully while your own mind betrays you with worries and doubts – is among the worst parts of not being able to sleep. Enter Casper’s amazingly named Insomnobot 3000 (which truly is one of the most tongueincheek, retro-futuristic names for a chatbot I’ve ever come across), a conversational agent that aims to give insomniacs someone to talk to while the rest of the world rests easy. At this point, Insomnobot 3000 is a little rudimentary. The responses offered by the agent aren’t quite right. But I’m not sure whether chatting with a bot would help me sleep, but at least it’d stop me from scrolling through the never-ending horrors of my Twitter timeline at 4 a.m.  
 
3.	UNICEF: Helping Marginalized Communities Be Heard : So far, with the exception of Endurance’s dementia companion bot, the chatbots we’ve looked at have mostly been littlemore than cool novelties. International child advocacy non-profit UNICEF, however, is using chatbots to help people living in developing nations speak out about the most urgent needs in their communities. The bot, called U-Report, focuses on largescale data gathering via polls – this isn’t a bot for the talkative. U-Report regularly sends out prepared polls on a range of urgent social issues, and users (known as “UReporters”) can respond with their input. UNICEF then uses this feedback as the basis for potential policy recommendations. In one particularly striking example of how this rather limited bot has made a major impact, UReport sent a poll to users in Liberia about whether teachers were coercing students into sex in exchange forbetter grades. Approximately 86% of the13,000 Liberian children UReport polled responded that their teachers were engaged in this despicable practice, which resulted in a collaborative project between UNICEF and Liberia’s Minister of Education to put an end to it.  
4.	Med What: Making Medical Diagnoses Faster :If you’re the kind of person who has WebMD bookmarked, it might be worth checking out Med What.  
 
This chatbot aims to make medical diagnoses faster, easier, and more transparent for both patients and physicians – think of it like an intelligent version of WebMD that you can talk to. MedWhat is powered by a sophisticated machine learning system that offers increasingly accurate responses to user questions based on behaviours that it “learns” by interacting with human beings. In addition to the evergrowing range of medical questions fielded by MedWhat,the bot also draws upon vast volumes of medical research and peer-reviewed scientific papers to expand upon its already considerable wealth of medical expertise. In many ways, MedWhat is much closer to a virtual assistant (like Google Now) rather than a conversational agent. It also represents an exciting field of chatbot development that pairs intelligent NLP systems with machine learning technology to offer users an accurate and responsive experience.  
 
5.	ALICE: The Bot That Launched a Thousand… Other Bots : No list of innovative Chatbots would be complete without mentioning ALICE, one of the very first bots to go online – and one that’s held up incredibly well despite being developed and launched more than 20 years ago. ALICE – which stands for Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity, anacronym that could have been lifted straight out of an episode of The XFiles – was developed and launched by creator Dr. Richard Wallace way back in the dark days of the early Internet in 1995. (As you can see in the image above, the website’s aesthetic remains virtually unchanged since that time, a powerful reminder of how far web design has come.)Despite the fact that ALICE relies on such an old codebase, the bot offers users a remarkably accurate conversational experience. Of course, no bot is perfect, especially one that’s old enough to legally drink in the U.S. if only it had a physical form. ALICE, like many contemporary bots, struggles with the nuances of some questions and returns a mixture of inadvertently postmodern answers and statements that suggest ALICE has greater selfawareness for which we might give the agent credit. For all its drawbacks, none of today’s chatbots would have been possible without the groundbreaking work of Dr. Wallace. Also, Wallace’s bot served as the inspiration for the companion operating system in Spike Jonze’s 2013 science- fiction romance movie, Her. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          ----------METHODOLOGY---------- 
 
 
A natural-language-processing chatbot takes some combination of steps to convert text or speech into structured data that may be used to select the proper response. 
Here are some of the possible NLP steps. 
•	Tokenization. Given a string of words (characters), the natural language processor will divide those words into pieces or tokens that are linguistically significant or otherwise useful for the application. 
•	Named entity recognition. Looks for categories of words, like the name of a product, a person’s name, or an address. 
•	Normalization. Processes text in an effort to find common spelling or typographical errors that might impact meaning. 
•	Part of speech tagging. Identifies parts of speech — nouns, verbs — in the text with the aim of understanding complex sentence structures and how those structures impact meaning. 
•	Dependency parsing. Looks for subjects and objects in the given text to find dependent phrases. 
•	Sentiment analysis. Watches to learn if the human user is having a good experience or if the chat conversation should be elevated, if you will, to a human operator

 ADVANTAGES: 
 
24-hour availability 
According to studies, over 50% of customers expect a business to be available 24/7. Waiting for the next available operator for minutes is not a solved problem yet, but chatbots are the closest candidates to ending this problem. Maintaining a 24/7 response system brings continuous communication between the seller and the customer 
Instant answers 
An operator can concentrate on one customer at a time and answer one question. However, a chatbot can answer thousands of questions at the same time 
Multi language 
One of the advantages of chatbots is that they can support multiple languages which is especially useful for global brands.  
Endless patience 
While customer reps and customers sometimes lose their patience, that’s something bots are yet incapable of.  
Cost savings 
Companies’ need for growing the customer service department can be managed by rolling out increasingly capable bots handling more and more complex queries. The implementation of chatbots will create a certain amount of investment costs. 
 
 
 
 
 Applications of Chatbots: 

Content delivery- 
Media Publishers have realized that chatbots are a powerful way to engage with their audiences and monitor engagement to gain valuable insights on reader interests. 
 
 Order Food- 
Various fast food giants like KFC and Pizza Hut have invested in Chatbots that enable customers to place their orders through conversations. Book Flights 
Airlines are also applying chatbots to their business operations, for instance, Icelandair’s chatbot gives their customers the ability to search for and book flights in a text-based conversational manner. 

Companionship- 
Russian technology company Endurance developed its companion chatbot for Senior People and Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease. 
 
 

 
                                                           -----------CONCLUSION---------- 
 
A chatbot is one of the simple ways to transport data from a computer without having to think for proper keywords to look up in a search or browse several web pages to collect information; users can easily type their query in natural language and retrieve information. In this paper, information about the design, implementation of the chatbot has been presented. From the survey above, it can be said that the development and improvement of chatbot design grow at an unpredictable rate due to variety of methods and approaches used to design a chatbot. Chatbot is a great tool for quick interaction with the user. They help us by providing entertainment, saving time and answering the questions that are hard to find. The Chatbot must be simple and conversational. Since there are many designs and approaches for creating a chatbot, it can be at odds with commercial considerations. Researchers need to interact and must agree on a common approach for designing a Chatbot. In this project, we show Basic functionality of chatbot .
